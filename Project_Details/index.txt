Notes : 

In Javascript, code is parsed, compiled and executed from top
to bottom!

You can't use local/block-scope variables/constants(i.e., declared inside 
of functions) outside of that particular function!

Question : What is Shadowing?
Answer :
It is a process by which we can declare the same variable again that 
declared outside of the function.

# Project Javascript Definition :

* Created a vendor.js file.
* Retrieved required elements of HTML file using document object and getElementById() method
inside vendor.js.
* Created a function that changes the text-content of some HTML elements 
dynamically.

* Created an app.js file.
* Created some helper functions one of which returns the user input data 
and the other one writes a description or calculation log and also it invokes 
the function defined inside the vendor.js file with the required arguments 
being provided. 
* Also, refactor the code for code reuse.
* Also created some functions for different operations like addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division, and defined the logic inside of it as a function body.

* At last added some meaningful comments to the code.

* And thus became an unconventional calculator as it works slightly 
different from the conventional calculator.
